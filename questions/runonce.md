# Activate a command *once* when a player does something (e.g: enters an area)

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|In bedrock `distance` does not exist so instead of `distance=..X` use `r=X` and instead of `distance=X..` use `rm=X` and instead of `distance=X..Y` use `rm=X,r=Y`, all methods only work in Java unless stated otherwise|

This makes a command act as if it was on a comparator, without the lag and multiplayer incompatibility that comes from using a comparator. The general idea here is to select players that match a selector, but did **not** match that same selector in the previous tick. For example, players who have just entered an area (with `@a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1]`), just gained level 5 (with `@a[level=5]`), just entered creative (with `@a[gamemode=creative]`), etc.  

## Scoreboard

For this method, our first command checks two things: Your condition for running the command (e.g. `@a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1]`) and the condition that it didn't already match in the last tick (e.g. `[scores={matched=0}]`). We're storing the success of your condition in a scoreboard in the second command through a success check:

```mcfunction
# In chat / load function
scoreboard objectives add matched dummy

# Command blocks / tick function
execute as @a[scores={matched=0},x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] run say I just entered the area!
execute as @a store success score @s matched if entity @s[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1]
```

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|The order in which the commands are executed is important here. In the first command you check your condition and execute the command, and the second command store the success of executing your condition|

The previous example doesn't work in Bedrock Edition. Here is a setup that works in both Java and Bedrock Edition (if you change `distance=..X` to `rm=X`):

```mcfunction
execute as @a[scores={matched=0},x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] run say I just entered the area!
scoreboard players set @a[scores={matched=0},x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] matched 1
execute as @a unless entity @s[scores={matched=1},x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] run scoreboard players set @s matched 0
```

Besides the player, this could be some kind of global event, for example, it started to rain (Java 1.20.5+):

```
# Command blocks / tick function
execute if score #raining matched matches 0 if predicate {condition:"weather_check",raining:true} run say It's starting to rain!
execute store result score #raining matched if predicate {condition:"weather_check",raining:true}
```

## Advancements

If you are using a datapack and need to do a lot of similar checks, then you can use [advancements](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement/JSON_format) in the datapack for this.

This method involves creating a [predicate](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Predicate) that you check against the player, in this example, we want to know whether the player is at the server spawn area (`predicate example:at_spawn`). Then we create two advancements - the first one checks the predicate (player is at spawn), and the second one inverts this check (player isn't at spawn). Then, inside the run function, you execute the desired command when the player enters / leaves spawn and revoke the opposite advancement.

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|In the predicate `example:at_spawn` omits the Y position check, so a player at any height in the specified area will match the conditions of the predicate|

Such a check may seem very large, but this method allows you not to check the same condition 2 times per tick, but only 1 time per second (because the `minecraft:location` advancement trigger only runs once per second), which can be important with a large online number of players.

## Add/remove tag

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|This method will work in Bedrock too|

The following commands, running in this order, will keep track of whether a player matched the selector `@a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1]`:

```mcfunction
tag @a[tag=alreadyMatched] remove alreadyMatched
tag @a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] add alreadyMatched
```

Players who matched the selector will get the `alreadyMatched` scoreboard tag (you can call this scoreboard tag whatever you want, so long as you're consistent with it). At the start of the next tick, players who matched the selector in the previous tick will have the `alreadyMatched` scoreboard tag. This means that we can select players who don't have the scoreboard tag (`tag=!alreadyMatched`, meaning they didn't match in the previous tick) but do *now* match the selector:

```mcfunction
# Command blocks / tick function
execute as @a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1,tag=!alreadyMatched] run say I just entered the area!
tag @a[tag=alreadyMatched] remove alreadyMatched
tag @a[x=73,y=10,z=3,distance=..1] add alreadyMatched
```
