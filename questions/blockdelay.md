## Bedrock

In the Bedrock edition of the game, you can just give a commandblock a delay directly through its interface, no need for any workarounds, unless you want to make a timer for every player, see the method using a [scoreboard](#scoreboard)

## Java 

Using repeaters with command blocks (or a hopper clock) is considered bad practice, it causes more lag, and is often impractical for long delays. Alternatives include area effect cloud timers, scoreboard timers and the `schedule` command (requires functions). They all have their respective use cases, but the most commonly used one are the scoreboard timer for delaying a specific command or the `schedule` one for global commands (as they don't keep context).

### Area Effect Clouds

Area effect clouds (AECs) have a `Duration` tag and an `Age` tag. Their `Age` will increase at a rate of 1 per tick. When its `Age` gets to its `Duration`, the AEC will disappear.

For example, the following creates an AEC that will disappear in 100 ticks (5 seconds), as their `Age` defaults to 0:

```mcfunction
summon area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {Duration:100}
```

| üìù Note |
|---------|
|To see area_effect_cloud press `F3 + B` to show hitboxes|

You can set the `Duration` tag as a positive value or the `Age` tag as a negative value, but then you need to set the `Particle` tag to `"block air"` (1.20.4 and below) or `{type:"block",block_state:"minecraft:air"}` (1.20.5 and above) to prevent it from creating particles.

We can also summon it with a tag to select it with later:
```mcfunction
# 1.20.4 and below
summon area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["delay"],Age:-100,Particle:"block air"} 

# 1.20.5 and above
summon area_effect_cloud ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["delay"],Age:-100,Particle:{type:"block",block_state:"minecraft:air"}} 
```

The following 3 commands, in this order on a repeating-chain clock, will tag any AEC that's reached `Age:-1` with `delayActivating`, then make them activate (by turning on/off) an impulse command block at their position:

```mcfunction
tag @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=delay,nbt={Age:-1}] add delayActivating
execute at @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=delayActivating] run data merge block ~ ~ ~ {auto:true}
execute at @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=delayActivating] run data merge block ~ ~ ~ {auto:false}
```

That means that if you have those 3 commands repeating somewhere in your world, the command `/summon area_effect_cloud X Y Z {Tags:[delay],Age:-##,Particle:{type:"block",block_state:"minecraft:air"}}` can be used to activate the command block at (X, Y, Z) in ## ticks. An example, that'll activate the block at (10, 64, 30) in 70 ticks:

```mcfunction
summon area_effect_cloud 10 64 30 {Tags:["delay"],Age:-70,Particle:{type:"block",block_state:"minecraft:air"}}
```

However, if you want to use spawn_egg to simply create an AEC's for delay, then you need to add Radius and WaitTime:

```mcfunction
# 1.13 - 1.20.4
give @s bat_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:area_effect_cloud",Tags:["delay"],Duration:100,Radius:0f,WaitTime:0}}

# 1.20.5+
give @s bat_spawn_egg[entity_data={id:"minecraft:area_effect_cloud",Tags:["delay"],Duration:100,Radius:0f,WaitTime:0}]
```

| üìù Note |
|---------|
|You can use any `spawn_egg`, but not just `bat_spawn_egg`|
```mcfunction
# Command block / tick function
execute at @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=delay,nbt={Age:99}] run summon zombie
```

This is a simple way to execute any command at a specified position once with a specified delay.

### Marker

If you need to execute a command not only once, but every 5 seconds, for example, at specific location, then you can use the [marker entity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Marker) (1.17+) for this. If you are on an earlier version use an [`area_effect_cloud`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lingering_Potion#Area_effect_cloud) that will not despawn or an invisible [`armor_stand`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor_Stand).

```mcfunction
# Summon
summon marker ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["delay"]}

# Spawn egg
## 1.17 - 1.20.4
give @s bat_spawn_egg{EntityTag:{id:"minecraft:marker",Tags:["delay"]}}

## 1.20.5+
give @s bat_spawn_egg[entity_data={id:"minecraft:marker",Tags:["delay"]}]
```

In addition to the marker, you need to use a scoreboard timer, which each tick will add 1 to the score marker.
```mcfunction
# Command blocks / tick function
scoreboard players add @e[type=marker,tag=delay] timer 1
execute as @e[type=marker,tag=delay,scores={delay=100..}] at @s store success score @s delay run summon zombie
```

### Scoreboard
#### Java 1.13+ and Bedrock
For a scoreboard timer you can have a repeating commandblock somewhere that's counting up/down in a particular scoreboard objective and then use `execute if score` in the commandblock that should have the delay. You can either use individual player scores (recommended for player dependent events/delays) or "[fake player](/wiki/questions/fakeplayer)" scores (set "fake" values for player names, recommended for player independent delays).

```mcfunction
# Setup
scoreboard objectives add timer dummy

# The repeating command_block
scoreboard players add @a timer 1

# The command_block that should run for every player with a timer score of 100
execute as @a[scores={timer=100}] run say This command has 5 seconds delay.
scoreboard players reset @a[scores={timer=100..}] timer

# Alternatively for a fake player timer
scoreboard players add $FakePlayer timer 1
execute if score $FakePlayer timer matches 120 run say This command has 6 seconds delay.
execute if score $FakePlayer timer matches 120.. run scoreboard players reset $FakePlayer timer
```

Or, if you do not create additional conditions, you can immediately reset the score in one command using `store success score` (only java edition):

```mcfunction
# Command blocks
execute as @a[scores={timer=101..}] store success score @s timer run say This command has 5 seconds delay.
execute if score $FakePlayer timer matches 121.. store success score $FakePlayer timer run say This command has 6 seconds delay.
```

This command will not only execute the command, it also works as a timer reset command, however this implementation may not have the exact delay in some cases where your command is executed in some conditions and not in another.

You can also make the delay more dynamic by setting a score of a fake player and comparing it to the players score:

```mcfunction
# Set delay
scoreboard players set #delay timer 300

# Command block / tick function
execute as @a if score @s timer >= #delay timer store success score @s timer run say Custom delay command.
```

#### Java pre-1.13
Before 1.13 we didn't have `execute if score` so we will need to use `scoreboard players test` for that.

```mcfunction
# command block
scoreboard players add FakePlayerA TimerScore 1
scoreboard players test FakePlayerA TimerScore 60
# Chain conditional
scoreboard players set FakePlayerA TimerScore 0
# Conditional repeating command
<any command>
```

### Schedule

Using functions the [schedule command](https://minecraft.wiki/Commands/schedule) can be used to make a function run in ## amount of ticks.

```mcfunction
schedule function <function> <time> [append|replace]
```

So you can create a simple way to run your commands not every tick, but, for example, once a second:

```mcfunction
# function example:load
function example:loops/10s

# function example:loops/10s
schedule function example:loops/10s 10s
say This will run every 10 second.
```

| üìù Note |
|---------|
|Do not run the schedule function in a tick function, without any conditions. This will overwrite the schedule every tick and the schedule function will never run|

This has several limitations:

1. Even when using `/execute as`, the scheduled function will always run as the Server, but not as the selected entity. See [command context](/wiki/questions/commandcontext)
2. Scheduling the same function before it is successfully ran will by default overwrite the previous schedule: if you schedule a function to happen in 5 seconds, then schedule the same function again before the 5 seconds are up, the new schedule will be the one that happens. **Since 1.15 you can now add the `append` argument as the last argument in the command, which circumvents this problem**.  
3. It requires functions and thus datapacks to work.
4. It will be executed at position Y = -64 under the world spawn.

```mcfunction
# In chat
execute as @a run schedule function example:some_function 5s

# function example:some_function
say This is a message from the server.
```

If you want to schedule a function to execute as an entity, here is a method that allows you to do that with different schedules for different entities:

Read the current gametime and store it in the score of the selected entity and add your delay to this score. Then run the schedule function and count the gametime again and find the entities with the same score value.

```mcfunction
# Run shedule function (as entity)
execute store result score @s timer run time query gametime
scoreboard players add @s timer 150
schedule function example:delay_function 150t append

# function example:delay_function
execute store result score #this timer run time query gametime
execute as @e if score @s timer = #this timer run say Example Command.
```

| üìù Note |
|---------|
|If you frequently run the schedule function to delay, then use `append` mode to run the schedule function so that each run does not overwrite the previous one|

### Success Count
An easy trick with command blocks to make a clock run at half its speed is the following command:

```mcfunction
# pre-1.13 syntax
testforblock ~ ~ ~ repeating_command_block * {SuccessCount:0}
# 1.13+ syntax
execute if block ~ ~ ~ repeating_command_block{SuccessCount:0}
# 1.13+ syntax (only run one command)
execute if block ~ ~ ~ repeating_command_block{SuccessCount:0} run <command>
```

Set up [like this](http://i.imgur.com/OULTCZx.png) (unless running only one command), the command will alternate between succeeding (as it failed last time so has `SuccessCount:0`) and failing (as it succeeded last time so has `SuccessCount:1`), and the conditional repeating block coming off of it will thus activate every other tick.

These cause no block updates and require no entities or scoreboard objectives, but are limited to halving the speed of the first block.


### Command block minecart
The entity [`command_block_minecart`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecart_with_Command_Block) execute the written command every 4 ticks. Keep in mind that people can break the minecart (but it will **not** drop the command block).

### Falling blocks or entities
Other methods such as a falling block clock exist and can be convenient, but cause block updates, lighting updates, and requires an entity.

In this example we use an armor stand with the tag `loop`, we will place a pressure plate with an impulse command block below with the following command:

```mcfunction
execute as @e[tag=loop,distance=..3,type=armor_stand] at @s run tp @s ~ ~5 ~
```
To add more commands, just add a chain one to the previous impulse.
