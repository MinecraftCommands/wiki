# Check if there are exactly X players matching a selector

For example, you want to check if a team has exactly 2 players. 

> [!NOTE]
> if a selector such as `@a[team=red]` selects `Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave`, then `@a[team=red,limit=2]` will select `Alice, Bob` and run the command on those players. `limit=2` does not mean *"only run if there are 2 players"*, but rather *"limit the players selected to at most 2"*. (Same for `c` in bedrock).

A command will still run (and potentially succeed once) even if `@a[team=red,limit=2]` only finds one player, and succeeding once is all that is needed for conditional blocks coming off of the command block to run.

## Java and Bedrock

The easiest way to do this in bedrock is to have the found entities count up the score of another entity or a [fake player](/wiki/questions/fakeplayer) (the later is currently a little harder to check for their score, so it is not used in this tutorial).

Using a dummy scoreboard objective named `result` and an entity with the `counter` tag, we can count how many players there are in team red:

    scoreboard players set @e[tag=counter] result 0
    execute as @a[team=red] run scoreboard players add @e[tag=counter] result 1
    execute as @e[tag=counter,scores={result=2}] run say there are exactly 2 people on the red team

You can also use [ranges](wiki/questions/ranges)

    execute as @e[tag=counter,scores={result=2..}] run say there are 2 or more people on the red team
    execute as @e[tag=counter,scores={result=..2}] run say there are 2 or less people on the red team
    execute as @e[tag=counter,scores={result=2..9}] run say there are between 2 and 9 people on the red team

You can use a comparator with the `/testfor` command, the output, in signal strengh, is the same as the number of online players.

## Java 

### Method 1: Storing the found entities using `execute store`

Introduced in 1.13 and replacing the `/stats` command, the `store` subcommand of `execute` is able to store the result of the command after it in multiple ways, including into a scoreboard.  
Using a dummy scoreboard objective name `result` and the [fake player](/wiki/questions/fakeplayer) `#count`, we can count the amount of entities a command finds and then execute off of that. Note that we can use [ranges](wiki/questions/ranges)

    execute store result score #count result if entity @a[team=red]
    execute if score #count result matches 2 run say there are exactly 2 players on team red.

The fake player can be replaced by an entity, which then changes the second command to  

    execute if entity @e[<your entity>,scores={result=2}] run say there are exactly 2 players on team red.

It also works with [ranges](wiki/questions/ranges)

    execute if score #count result matches 2.. run say there are 2 or more players on team red.
    execute if score #count result matches ..2 run say there are 2 or less players on team red.

### Method 2: Checking the command block's `SuccessCount`

When a `/testfor` command is run, the command block's `SuccessCount` NBT tag will be set equal to the number of entities that the selector found. You can then use a `/testforblock` command in another block to check whether the first command block's `SuccessCount` is a certain number.

For example, this will test for *exactly* 2 players on the red team (no more, no less):

    testfor @a[team=red]
    testforblock X Y Z command_block -1 {SuccessCount:2}

Change `X Y Z` in the second command block to the coordinates of the first command block. You may also need to change `command_block` to `chain_command_block` or `repeating_command_block`.

The second command will only succeed if the first command has a SuccessCount of 1 (it found exactly 1 player). You can then run a conditional chain block off of that second command to activate whatever you want to happen when there are exactly 1 player:

### Method 3: With `/stats` (1.8-1.12)

> [!NOTE]
> This method is outdated and can not be used in current versions of the game.

Stats are harder to understand and set up, but gives you more flexibility (works in functions, can test a range rather than exact values, can test things other than SuccessCount). If you have not used `/stats` in the past, you will need to watch/read a tutorial (or multiple) and play around with them until you are confident in its usage. Then:

 * Set an entity's `SuccessCount` to store in a scoreboard objective (e.g: its `SuccessScore`)
 * Execute off of that entity to run the command (e.g: `testfor @a[team=red]`)
 * You can now check `score_SuccessScore_min=2,score_SuccessScore=2` of that entity
