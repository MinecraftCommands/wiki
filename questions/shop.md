## Item shop
This method consists of buying items with other items, in this example, you will buy 1 netherite ingot with 5 diamonds.

|--------------|
|You can add any command you want to run (for example a playsound) before the last command, but the selector must be the same as the command before|


### Java

#### Using commands
First we figure out how many diamonds the player has and store the value in a scoreboard. If the player has the required number of diamonds we give the netherite ingot and clear the diamonds from them.

Using command blocks we need to make sure we select the correct player every time, so with the first command we tag the relevant player to later limit our selector to that player.

To avoid the player getting unintentionally re-selected we remove the tag at the end.
Using functions we can rely on `@s` instead, assuming the function is executed `as` the relevant player.

```mcfunction
# Command blocks
tag @p add buyer.netherite
execute as @a[tag=buyer.netherite] store result score @s diamonds run clear @s diamond 0
give @a[tag=buyer.netherite,scores={diamonds=5..}] netherite_ingot 1
clear @a[tag=buyer.netherite,scores={diamonds=5..}] diamond 5
tellraw @a[tag=buyer.netherite,scores={diamonds=5..}] {"text":"You bought a netherite ingot for 5 diamonds","color":"green"}
tellraw @a[tag=buyer.netherite,scores={diamonds=..4}] {"text":"You don't have 5 diamonds","color":"dark_red"}
tag @a remove buyer.netherite
```

Or if you prefer a function:

```mcfunction
# function example:load
scoreboard objectives add diamonds dummy

# function example:buy/netherite
execute store result score @s diamonds run clear @s diamond 0
execute if entity @s[scores={diamonds=5..}] run function example:buy/netherite/success
execute unless entity @s[scores={diamonds=5..}] run tellraw @s {"text":"You don't have 5 diamonds","color":"dark_red"}

# function example:buy/netheirte/success
give @s netherite_ingot 1
clear @s diamond 5
tellraw @s {"text":"You bought a netherite ingot for 5 diamonds","color":"green"}
```

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|The function `example:buy/netherite` must be run `as` the player|

In 1.20.5 `execute if items` was added, which allows to count items in a diferent way.
To use this method, all command remains the same, as the previus example except the one for counting items that is this one:

```mcfunction
execute as @a[tag=buyer.netherite] store result score @s diamonds run clear @s diamond 0
```
That we can replace it for this one:
```mcfunction
execute as @p[tag=buyer.netherite] store result score @s diamonds if items entity @s container.* diamond
```
Or if you are using the example function, you need to replace this command
```mcfunction
execute store result score @s diamonds run clear @s diamond 0
```
With this command:

execute store result score @s diamonds if items entity @s container.* diamond

| üìù Note |

|The method that uses the `/clear` command will work in 1.20.5+ but it is recomended to use the one specific for that versions (using `execute if items`, that will not work below 1.20.5)|

#### Using a villager
Villagers are a passive mob that can be interacted with, and will open the trading GUI.

We can use this vanilla functionality to add our custom trades.

This can be done by manually typing the command, but it is recomeneded to use an [online generator](https://mcstacker.net) to generate the command with ease.

This method has some advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages:**
* Easy to set up, it only require a summon command.
* It does not cause performance issues, as we don't run any commands.

**Disadvantages:**
* Need to be interacted. You can't force the player to buy that item.
* Limited to give 2 items to get one (workarrounds are possible, like giving a shulker box with items in it).
* You can't show a succes message (workarrounds are possible).
* It is linked to a place, unless you teleport the villager to the player.
* 2 players can't acces the trading screen at the same time.

Here is an example command:
```mcfunction
/summon villager ~ ~ ~ {Offers:{Recipes:[{rewardExp:0b,maxUses:2147483647,buy:{id:"minecraft:diamond",count:1},buyB:{id:"minecraft:emerald",count:1},sell:{id:"minecraft:netherite_ingot",count:1}}]}}
```

Let's break it down:
* Inside `Offers` we have `Recipes`, there will be all listed trades.
* This trade has `rewardExp:0b` so the player will not get any experience when buying it (you can enable it if you want).
* `maxUses:2147483647` is the maximum times it can be traded, this is the maximum value we can set.
* Inside `buy` and `buyB` we are going to specify what items the player will spend.
* In `sell` we specify what item the player will get.

We can use item components or nbt for both the item the player will spend and the item the player will get, here is an example for 1.20.5+, every item needs to have a `custom_data` of `special:true`

```mcfunction
/summon villager ~ ~ ~ {Offers:{Recipes:[{rewardExp:0b,maxUses:2147483647,buy:{id:"minecraft:diamond",count:1,components:{"minecraft:custom_data":{special:true}}},buyB:{id:"minecraft:emerald",count:1,components:{"minecraft:custom_data":{special:true}}},sell:{id:"minecraft:netherite_ingot",count:1,components:{"minecraft:custom_model_data":special:true}}}]}}
```
Here is the same command but for pre-1.20.5, using nbt data instead:


```mcfunction
/summon villager ~ ~ ~ {Offers:{Recipes:[{rewardExp:0b,maxUses:2147483647,buy:{id:"minecraft:diamond",Count:1b,tag:{special:true}},buyB:{id:"minecraft:emerald",Count:1b,tag:{special:true}},sell:{id:"minecraft:netherite_ingot",Count:1b,tag:{special:true}}}]}}
```

### Bedrock
In bedrock we have the `hasitem` argument, so it uses less commands than in Java.

If you don't want to use an NPC can use this method, it is very similar to Java but it uses the `hasitem` argument instead.

```mcfunction
# Command blocks
tag @p add buyer.netherite
give @a[tag=buyer.netherite,hasitem={item=diamond,quantity=5..}] netherite_ingot
tellraw @a[tag=buyer.netherite,hasitem={item=diamond,quantity=5..}] {"rawtext":[{"text":"¬ß2You bought a netherite ingot"}]}
tellraw @a[tag=buyer.netherite,hasitem={item=diamond,quantity=..5}] {"rawtext":[{"text":"¬ß3You don't have 5 diamonds"}]}
clear @a[tag=buyer.netherite,hasitem={item=diamond,quantity=5..}] diamond 5
tag @a remove buyer.netherite
```

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|in order for it to work with npc, change `@p` and `@a` to `@initiator`|
|_Related: [How to setup a NPC?](/wiki/questions/npc)_|

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|It is super important to clear the diamonds in the last step before removing the tag|

### Add more than one items
In this gide we will use just one item, but you can have multiples but it will require a second tag, that must be added if the player has both items.
Then when we clear the items we are going to clear them for the player with that tag.

In this example we will buy a gold block with 2 emeralds and 5 diamonds. If you are in Java you will need one scoreboard for each item, assuming you already store the items result in each one.

```mcfunction
# Command blocks
tag @p add buyer.example
execute as @a[tag=buyer.example] run tag @s[scores={diamonds=5..,emeralds=2..}] add buy.example
# Run any tellraw to the player with the tag buy.example
clear @a[tag=buy.example] diamond 5
clear @a[tag=buy.example] emerald 2
give @a[tag=buy.example] gold_block 1

# And then we remove all the previus used tags
tag @a remove buy.example
tag @a remove buyer.example
```

In bedrock use the `hasitem` argument instead of `scores`

## Score shop
This method uses a scoreboard as a currency (such as `coins` for this example) and you can buy items with that currency. In this example, you can buy a `diamond` with 10 `coins`.
You can adjust the items and the prices by editing the command item and quantity.

### Java and Bedrock
When the player wants to buy the item, run this commands in order. It can be achieved with a button, an impulse command block and a chain of command blocks behind as an example.
In this example the currency is a `dummy` scoreboard called `coins`.

#### With command blocks

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|This example uses Java syntax for the message that appears when the player buys the item|

```mcfunction
tag @p add buyer.diamond
execute as @p[tag=buyer.diamond] run tag @s[scores={coins=10..}] add buy.diamond
scoreboard players remove @a[tag=buy.diamond] coins 10
tellraw @a[tag=buyer_diamond,tag=!buy.diamond] "You need at least 10 coins"
tellraw @a[tag=buy.diamond] "You bought a diamond"
tag @a remove buy.diamond
tag @a remove buyer.diamond
```

#### In a function
This is more optimized compared to using command blocks as functions keep the context

```mcfunction
# function example:buy/diamond
execute if entity @s[scores={coins=10..}] run function example:buy/diamond/success
tellraw @s[scores={coins=..9}] {"text":"You don't have 10 coins","color":"red"}

# function example:buy/diamond/success
give @s diamond
scoreboard players remove @s coins 10
tellraw @s {"text":"You bought a diamond","color":"green"}
```

| üìù Note |
|--------------|
|The function `example:buy/diamond` must be run `as` the player|
